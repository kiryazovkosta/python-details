TXT document files are plain text files that contain only unformatted text.
They do not contain any formatting or layout information, and are often used for
storing simple text documents or data sets. They can be opened and edited with
any text editor, such as Notepad on a Windows computer or TextEdit on a Mac.
They are commonly used for storing things like notes, lists, scripts, or code
snippets, and are often used in combination with other file formats, such as
HTML or XML, to store data that will be displayed on the web or in other applications.
